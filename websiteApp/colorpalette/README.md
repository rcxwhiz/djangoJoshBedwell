#Color Palette Generator

This project uses `Pillow` to edit an image in Python and `sklearn` and `scipy` to identify a specified number of groups
of colors in the distribution of pixels in the image. It then appends samples of these colors to the bottom of the image
and can also add the color codes. It also has a couple of options that can tweak the final result.
